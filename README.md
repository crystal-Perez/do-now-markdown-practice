# My favorite memory at MESA South Brooklyn
It was Friday at **MESA**, I was heading upstairs for my last class of the day, Algebra 1. When I enter the room, the seats were moved for a **collboration project**. I checked the board and found myself to be sitting with *Mubina*. I sat with her during the period and quickly got along with her. We had fun during the class and she was able to help me with some work. At the end of the day, I was able to exchange socials with her so we could *connect* outside of school.
